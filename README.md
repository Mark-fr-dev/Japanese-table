# Mechanical Design and construction of a Kitchen Island Table

## Background

Commercially available items of furniture often do not fit one's personal needs. This project is an opportunity to show case some simple mechanical design capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯Objective

Design and build a good looking, functional kitchen table with a large surface area, that can be dismantled by hand, the parts of which can fit through a single door with minimal space to maneuver. 

## ðŸ¦¾Mechanical Design

The apron was designed with Japanese style castle joints and the bottom shelf frame was designed with tusk tenons, held in place by contrasting wooden pegs. Mechanical drawings were produced using Fusion 360.
